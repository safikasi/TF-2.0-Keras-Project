# 💸 Bank Note Authentication with Deep Learning 🔍🧠

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a wrap-up of my Deep Learning journey using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.  
I used a real-world dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** to detect whether a **bank note is authentic or forged**, based on image features.

---

## 📊 Dataset Summary

The dataset contains the following 5 features:

- `variance` – Variance of Wavelet Transformed image  
- `skewness` – Skewness of Wavelet Transformed image  
- `curtosis` – Curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image  
- `entropy` – Entropy of the image  
- `class` – Label: `0` = Forged, `1` = Authentic  

➡️ **Goal**: Predict the `class` using the other features.
